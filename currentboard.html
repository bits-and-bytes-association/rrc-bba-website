                            <p>Hey everyone, I'm Aaron, an IBIT graduate and currently in BTM. I initially got involved with BBA as an oppurtunity to enrich my college experience and meet students and industry reps alike. Entering the BTM program I had very little exposure to
                            the industry and thought this would be a great way to help other students facing this. I've always found that my most memorable semesters are when I'm active on campus. <br>My main goal is to ensure BBA is consistently hosting events and providing students with the oppurtunities that fit their respective goals and interests. Whether you're looking to hangout and unwind, work alongside Red River administration, 
                            or get involved in the industry, we've got something for you.</p>
